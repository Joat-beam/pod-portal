It is my goal to create a "Personal podcast viewing portal system"
that will allow users to add their own favorite podcast shows into a user account system ,
which in turn will show up as live if they are live streaming, and allow for older episode viewing via rss feeds. 
Content sources could include Youtube, Twitch , Vimeo, Mixer, Shoutcast , Icecast, RSS , XML , Etc..
or any other service that provides a api or backend syndication system to retreive information from via a system module or plugin.
